            <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Your Profile Picture">
            <p>I am a project manager and entrepreneur with a Bachelor's degree in Business Project Management and Information Systems. I have experience working as a project manager for several years before founding my own company at the age of 22.

At 25, I met the love of my life. Unfortunately, she was also a medical student. Being forced to choose between traveling with her for clinical studies and staying home to work on my business drove me to seek a career change that would facilitate our relationship together; this gave me the opportunity to pursue my childhood enthusiasm for technology while leveraging the lessons Iâ€™ve learned in both academic and real world business.

My key skills include project management, information systems management, and networking. I hold the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certifications, demonstrating my knowledge in IT infrastructure, network administration, and cybersecurity.

With a strong background in business project management and a passion for technology, I have a proven track record for generating tangible results. I am committed to leveraging my expertise and experience to drive effective project delivery and business growth.</p>
